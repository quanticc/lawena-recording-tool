# Lawena Contributing Guide

This is the Contributing.md file for **Lawena Recording Tool** project. Thanks for reading this! Hopefully you'll want to [get involved](#get-involved). There are lots of ways you can help, and if you do it following these guidelines, it will be useful for everyone and I'll gladly help you, reciprocating your respect.

### Summary

If you need help or have questions, please use the [issue tracker](#issues). If you're [raising a bug](#bugs) please be sure to [include as much info as possible](#bug-template) so that can be fixed. If you've got some code you want to [pull request](#pull-requests) please ask first and together we'll find a way to make it work.

Currently the only one actively developing Lawena Recording Tool is **Quantic** ([github](https://github.com/iabarca)) ([steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepropane/)). Montz is no longer developing the tool so don't bother him with requests. Maybe only to thank him for creating this great little piece of free software. If you want to help [in other ways](#get-involved), tell me about it via Steam.

## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/iabarca/lawena-recording-tool/issues) is
the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bugs), [feature requests](#features), [change requests](#changes) and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests). I am always actively monitoring everything that happens there. That being said, I **don't** monitor teamfortress.tv or similar forums because I like to have people's issues organized and a forum structure does not help at all.

## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported to avoid duplicates.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; check other branches or the recent closed issues, maybe it's been fixed but not yet pushed to the auto-updater.

3. **Include a screenshot or screencast if relevant** - Is your issue about a design or front end feature or bug? Use [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to quickly and easily record a short screencast (24fps) and save it as an animated gif! Embed it directly into your GitHub issue. Great.

4. **Include as much info as possible!** Use the **Bug Report template** below or [click this link](https://github.com/iabarca/lawena-recording-tool/issues/new?title=Bug%3A&body=%23%23%23%20Issue%20Summary%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Steps%20to%20Reproduce%0A%0A1.%20This%20is%20the%20first%20step%0A%0AThis%20is%20a%20bug%20because...%0A%0A%23%23%23%20Technical%20details%0A%0A*%20Lawena%20Version%3A%20INSERT%20VERSION%20OR%20COMMIT%20REF%0A*%20Game%3A%20%0A*%20Your%20OS%3A%20%0A*%20Log%20file%3A%20) to start creating a bug report with the template automatically.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. Any details will help people to fix any potential bugs.

### Feature Requests

I really like feature requests! Please use the issue tracker for this as well, stating that it's a feature request somewhere in there, after you do this:

1. Visit the [Roadmap](https://github.com/iabarca/lawena-recording-tool/wiki/Roadmap) & **use the GitHub search** to see if the feature has already been requested and then use the issue tracker to tell me about it.

2. Remember, it's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince me of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible, this means explaining the use case and why it is likely to be common.

<a name="changes"></a>
### Change Requests

Change requests cover both architectural and functional changes to how Lawena works. If you have an idea for a new or different dependency, a refactor, or an improvement to a feature, etc - please be sure to:

1. **Use the GitHub search** and check someone else didn't get there first

2. Consider the following:
	- Is it really one idea or is it many?
	- What problem are you solving?
	- Why is what you are suggesting better than what's already there?

And then use the issue tracker again for this.

<a name="pull-requests"></a>
### Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are **awesome**. If you're looking to raise a PR for something which doesn't have an open issue, please think carefully about [raising an issue](#raising-issues) which your PR can close, especially if you're fixing a bug. This makes it more likely that there will be enough information available for your PR to be properly tested and merged. The project is small so just submit the pull request and we'll make it work together!

### Get involved

You can also get involved helping with:

1. *Making sure Lawena does it's job* &mdash; Sometimes I mess up after an update. Please let me know! Also anything not working out correctly, I'm always listening.
2. *Contributing to the GitHub Wiki* &mdash; The [wiki](https://github.com/iabarca/lawena-recording-tool/wiki) in this repository is kind of abandoned. This also applies to documentation and help throughout the tool. I will greatly appreciate all contributions.
3. *Porting Lawena to other games* &mdash; The tool can work out with most Source games with little modifications. If you are interested or want to suggest a game let me know.
4. *Helping with translations* &mdash; Thank you very much! Contact me on [Steam](http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepropane) for details.
5. *Increasing Linux/OSX support* &mdash; Lawena theoretically supports those operating systems but the truth is that they are far from optimal. I'm looking for help especially about supporting OSX.

Use Steam for stuff not covered here. Issue tracker also works.
